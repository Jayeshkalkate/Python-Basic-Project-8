# Python-Basic-Project-8
By using python programming language

# Let us create a simple addition program.

# So our first step is get a number for performing addition program by using the variables .

variable_1 = (int(input("Enter the second number : ")))

variable_2 = (int(input("Entre the first number : ")))

# The + sign is used for perform addition between variable_1 and variable_2 .

addition = variable_1 + variable_2

print(f"The addition of first and second number is : {addition}")

# The - sign is used for perform subtraction between variable_1 and variable_2 .

subtraction = variable_1 - variable_2

print(f"The subtraction of first and second number is : {subtraction}")

# The * sign is used for perform multiplication between variable_1 and variable_2 .

multiplication = variable_1 * variable_2

print(f"The multiplication of first and second number is : {multiplication}")

# The / sign is used for perform division between variable_1 and variable_2 .

division = variable_1 / variable_2

print(f"The division of first and second number is : {division}")

# The % sign is used for perform modulus between variable_1 and variable_2 .

modulus = variable_1 % variable_2

print(f"The modulus of first and second number is : {modulus}")
